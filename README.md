# MTG LEGENDS CUBE (2018)

This is a custom set I designed years ago aiming for a singleton cube draft experience, with the cards featuring a high power level in general. It's interesting to see now how mtg evolved in parallel to this set, with for example the keyword 'mill' being created or the creation of "sagas" using an approach I almost used for quests, which I abandoned for judging it as "too passive". The set was also made before commander kind of took over mtg design, placing legendary creatures under a completely new light in official design. After I finished an early version of the set, I was able to playtest a bit with my Cube drafting group, and I decided to make some changes. I stalled for a long time, feeling insecure about it and also being too busy with my PhD. Then, in the beginning of 2020, we had big plans in my Cube group, we started making seasons of tournaments, with point systems and ranks, custom cards for tournament winners, etc, I decided to wrap my set to officially release it. Then, the pandemics hit... Since then, I never again played a proper cube draft irl tournament :( Now it's the end of 2023, my old computer was stolen and I never got to backup the original mse files, just the final result. I'm now posting it here with the plans to eventually convince a group of nice people to play it with me. The following is the set's description I made back then:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Legends Cube is a cube draft environment custom set that brings a new light to card concepts of the Legends set and a few other old cards.

I always viewed the Legends set as a wasted potential (with all due respect), it being filled with interesting card concepts and arts that were matched with disgustingly unplayable or broken designs. I wanted to play with those cards but they wouldn’t let me, so I decided to replace their designs, as a means of utility and reverence to their concepts.

So, my constraints at first were to use the original images, names, and flavor texts from all the Legends cards; but down the road I freely changed, twisted, added, or omitted some of the names and many flavor texts and included cards from other old sets in a specific manner so as to complete the cube and fill important purposes (like the need for more land cards). It’s relevant to note here that I worked with card concepts, not lore; in fact, I tried to forget everything I knew about the lore of Legends.

The idea of making it like a cube came naturally from my unbounded love for the format, but I also think that it ended up being crucial to guide my design.

The set is composed of 384 cards, divided into 8 piles of 48 cards (the piles are somewhat subjectively separated into the five colors, fixer lands, colorless, and multicolored). It can be drafted with booster packs of 16 cards, having 2 cards from each pile, on average (the last card of each round may be ignored to maintain player pool size); or it can be drafted leaving out 24 cards (then having a little random factor on the draft pool).

# 1) Goals

Two years back, my goals were:

1) To “restore” Legends.

2) To create an old school, kind of RPG, flavor of play.

3) To use the legendary matters theme in a positive, more interesting, way (the fact that a legendary card, mechanically, is just a card that makes you worry about copies is a kind of crap).

In decisions concerning game design and aesthetics, I moved away from the old school feeling (for example, my first print test was made with the old card frame, but I disliked the visual result more than I liked the vibe it created). Despite that (or more likely because of that), I also decided to commit myself to my first, old school “kind of RPG” oriented, design of the Quest cards and level counters, and make them work somehow (and I am still not quite sure whether the Quests work well). Also, no planeswalkers.

Two years later, I see my updated goals as:

1) To “restore” Legends.

2) To try to provide another cool experience for open-minded players (still with a little bit of old school flavor, I hope).

3) To stimulate cube drafting and the passion for magic design among the players; and with these two powers combined, to explore a closed cube environment design space yet majorly untouched (like closed-cube powerful cards that could never be printed in the outside world).

# 2) How to view the cards

It’s very easy to label the cards as overpowered, and I think they are, in general, as I tried to draw from the experience with cube drafting. It’s also very easy to label the cards as broken or non-functional when inserted in other forms of play or combined with existing cards, and I think this is not the right way of viewing them. I will state some guidelines for this:

1) The power level of the cards is intended to match the composition and functioning of a usual (not themed, but not necessarily powered) cube environment.

2) Many cards rely on limited and singleton deckbuilding.

3) The cards are to be treated in a closed form. No point in negative comparisons between these cards and existing magic cards.

4) In terms of rules and wording of the cards, I am doing my best and I don’t think that weird situations may arise with the cards as I intended them to behave. And I am aware of some bold leaps in rulings that I am taking, especially where types are concerned.

5) When you see a strange or seemingly non-intended piece of design, it is likely to be conscious, for better or worse.

6) I didn't fixate deck archetypes on purpose, because I don't want to put the possibilities on a frame. I like to explore this road in cube design, it's possible to work since the environment is so complex.

7) It’s nicer to experience the cards and the whole project from a positive stance; I am no master at this, and I also draw 90% of my inspiration from my own cube environment. Cube draft is already a fringe format, and my cube followed a non-conventional sandbox style that I tried to apply here, using lots of cards not usually featured in cube lists.

# 3) Rules and Mechanics

The Legends Cube has a few different mechanics, text abbreviations, and a new card type. I didn't rely much on new mechanics, trying to give a cube-like broad exploration of existing mechanics. First, I chose the names Level Up, Experience, and Quest because of their nice flavor; I feel that changing the name of the counters just to differentiate from the ROE level mechanic or simply making them +1/+1 does more harm than good. It's entirely parallel to the ROE mechanic, and while playing, if you are not very lost, you will never get confused about how Level Counters work here. I see the different mechanics and details as mere adjustments for the overall feeling. I didn't put reminders because it's all too easy to understand.

ETB
Means all forms related to entering the battlefield, like the forms in Quagmire Lunatic and Mountain Valley.

Mana of all colors
The set doesn't contain the colorless mana, but I used its code for my mana of all colors symbol, which is the same, but golden. It appears in the card's costs and abilities like Daughter of Autumn and Sylvan Library. Here, it substitutes "mana of any color", is a type of mana and counts as all colors.

Mill
An abbreviation that reads "Someone mills X cards" = "Someone puts the top X cards from his or her library into his or her graveyard". Like the card Syphon Soul.

Level Counters / Level up
They are a special type of counter. Creatures get +1/+1 for each level counter on them and a permanent with X level counters on it is at level X. The set doesn't contain +1/+1 counters and -1/-1 counters. When a permanent levels up, it's simply gaining a level counter. Examples: Holy Day, Hyperion Blacksmith.

Level X
As said above, a permanent is at level X if it has X level counters on it. A permanent can also have a Level X ability, that reads "Level X - []" = "If there are X or more level counters on it, it has “[]”". Examples: Primordial Ooze, Livonya the Blind Vendetta.

Experience
It's a triggered ability that gives level counters to permanents. It reads "Experience - []" = "[], put a level counter on it". Examples: Statue of Sir Shandlar of Eberyn, Adun Followed by Death

Quest
Quests are a new type of permanent. All quests have an ETB triggered ability and two statements written in their text boxes.

Each Quest has statements, called Missions. Every time a SBA is checked, incomplete Missions are checked, and if made true while the quest is on the battlefield, they are completed. A mission ceases to be completed only if an effect says so (and, naturally, if the quest ceases to exist as the same object), meaning that it doesn't matter if the statement is no longer true once you complete the quest Mission.

Quests have a Reward ability that says “If all Missions are complete, this permanent has ‘0: Transform this. If the other side is not a permanent, cast it. activate this ability only as a sorcery’. This doesn’t count as a permanent leaving the battlefield.

I designed quests to be double-face cards, but here I made them split cards for convenience.

People often question me why the quests aren't just enchantments with a quest subtype. I know they are not that mechanically different from enchantments, and I ended up with no cards that care about existing one more type of card. I kept it for three reasons. 1) Flavor: The way I see them, they are not enchantments, it feels weird to me. 2) Rules: There are just too many additional rules to quests, here is a good mechanical difference, rewards, mission abilities being included in SBA, etc. 3) Vulnerability: The rules for what can destroy a quest are different from the ones for enchantments.
